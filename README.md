# Games To Diamond
Project to determine how many games it would take (approximately) to reach a player's desired rank in League of Legends from their current rank, with a certain winrate. Uses 1000 simulations of your climb to do so.

Uses: Python, HTML, Javascript, jQuery, Flask

Offers two modes:
* Manual specification of aspects of the simulated player
* Automatic specification from a query of the player's account information

### The RiotWatcher API aspect is currently bugged due to changes in how RiotWatcher returns its data.
